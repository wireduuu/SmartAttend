What is GeoPresence?

GeoPresence is a smart, location-aware attendance and session management system designed to eliminate fake attendance (ghost names) in academic environments.

At its core, it answers one question reliably:

“Was this student physically present, at this place, at this time?”

The Problem GeoPresence Solves

Traditional attendance systems fail because:

Students sign for absent friends

Attendance sheets are reused

Online forms can be filled from anywhere

Lecturers waste time validating records

GeoPresence fixes this by binding attendance to location, time, and identity.

What GeoPresence Does (Plain Terms)
1. Secure Session-Based Attendance

Lecturers create a session (class, lab, exam, seminar).

A unique session code is generated

The session has:

A time window

A geo-fence (location radius)

Students can only mark attendance:

During the session time

Within the allowed location radius

Using their verified identity

2. Geo-Verified Student Presence

Students must:

Enter their index number and email

Be physically near the lecture venue

Submit within the active session window

This prevents:

Remote sign-ins

Shared links

Proxy attendance

3. Admin / Lecturer Dashboard

Lecturers and course reps can:

Create and manage courses

Start and stop attendance sessions

View live attendance counts

Export attendance records (CSV / PDF)

Detect anomalies (late sign-ins, duplicates)

4. Clean, Auditable Records

Every attendance record stores:

Student identity

Course

Session ID

Timestamp

Location metadata

This creates:

Trustworthy academic records

Audit-ready data for departments

What GeoPresence Is Not

To avoid confusion:

❌ Not a generic student portal

❌ Not just a QR scanner

❌ Not a Google Form clone

❌ Not a social app

GeoPresence is infrastructure, not content.

One-Sentence Definition (You’ll Use This Everywhere)

GeoPresence is a geo-verified attendance system that ensures students are physically present before attendance is recorded.
